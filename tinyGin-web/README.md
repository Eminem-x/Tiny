# Go Web Framework TinyGin form Scratch

The web framework of the Go language that I first came into contact with was Gin.

The total code of Gin is 14k, of which the test code is 9k, which means that the actual code is only 5k.

The aim is that use the Go language to implement a simple web famework named TinyGin like Gin.

At the same time, the functions implemented by many parts of this framework are very simple.

But try to reflect the core principles of a framework as much as possible.
